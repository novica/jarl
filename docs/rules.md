## Rules

All rules belong to at least one category:

-   CORR: correctness, code that is outright wrong or useless.
-   SUSP: suspicious, code that is most likely wrong or useless.
-   PERF: performance, code that can be written to run faster.
-   READ: readability, code is correct but can be written in a way that is easier to read.

You can find the list of available rules below, and more detailed explanations and examples in pages in the sidebar.

## Comparison to `lintr`

`lintr` includes many rules related to code formatting, such as [`brace_linter`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/dev/reference/brace_linter.html), [`line_length_linter`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/dev/reference/line_length_linter.html), and [`paren_body_linter`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/dev/reference/paren_body_linter.html), among others.

**Supporting those rules is not an objective of Jarl.**
Instead, I recommend using the [Air formatter](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/).

The column "Has fix?" can take the following values:

-   ✅ safe fix

-   ❗Unsafe fix

-   ❌ No fix
